# hello-world
introduction to anything hahaha

Just trying out github and learning the workflow.

For instance, I've already written a bit about myself on my personal profile-config branch. However, I can do it again. Hahahah

So, my name is Luis, I'm 23 years old, a bachelor's degree student and for now, I'm more driven to scientif programming, but, let's see what can I come up with. I'd would also enjoy to engage more with the open source community.
